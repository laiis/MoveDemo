Place three white pieces (O) and three black pieces (X) into the grid as shown below:

| O | O | O | space | X | X | X |

The question is: 

**How can we move the three white pieces to the positions occupied by the black pieces?** 

Rules:

1. A piece can be moved to an adjacent empty space.
2. A piece can jump over an adjacent piece and land on an empty space.
3. The formula for the minimum number of steps in a jump game with equal-length moves is as follows: steps = N * (N + 2)

Extended question:

If we replace the white pieces with lowercase English letters and the black pieces with uppercase English letters, please list the number of steps and the moves for all letters from 1 to 26.
